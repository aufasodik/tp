## Quick Start

Installation and first commands to get you started with Cerebro.

### Installation

1. **Check Java Version**

    - Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed.
        - If not, [follow these guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html) to install Java 17 on your system.
        - **Mac users:** Use the specific JDK version from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)
    - Verify installation: `java --version` in terminal
2. **Download Cerebro**

    - Download the latest `cerebro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F08a-1/tp/releases)
    - Choose a folder as your _home folder_ for Cerebro (e.g. `~/Applications/Cerebro/`)
3. **Launch Application**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/cerebro/folder
   java -jar cerebro.jar
   ```

After running `java -jar cerebro.jar`, you should see a window similar to below, preloaded with sample companies.

### CLI Tutorial

Command format and important information about using Cerebro's command line interface.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear` and `metrics`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

**Command Structure:** `command [index] [parameters]` with prefixes like `n/NAME`, `s/STATUS`, `t/TAG`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning:**
All operations are permanent! No undo available.
</div>

**Typical Workflow:**

1. **Research:** `add n/CompanyName` (quick entry)
2. **Add details:** `edit 1 e/contact_email@example.com a/Sample Address #00-00`
3. **Apply:** `edit 1 s/applied r/Applied via website`
4. **View info** `find CompanyName`
5. **Interview:** `edit 1 s/tech-interview`
6. **Overview:** `filter s/KEYWORD` to filter by status, `list` to see all

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Power Tips:**
**Batch edit/delete:** `delete 1,2,5-7` (indices 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)<br>
**Flexible input:** Parameters work in any order

### Editing a company : `edit`

Updates one or more companies in Cerebro.

**Format:** `edit INDEX(ES) [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/REMARK] [s/STATUS] [t/TAG]…`

**Edit Types:**

**Single Edit:** `edit INDEX [fields]`
```
edit 1 p/91234567 e/careers@google.com
→ Edited Company 1: Phone: 91234567; Email: careers@google.com; ...
```

**Batch Edit:** Edit multiple companies with the same changes

| Method | Format | Requirements           | Example | Result |
|--------|--------|------------------------|---------|--------|
| **Comma-separated** | `edit INDEX,INDEX,INDEX [fields]` | No trailing commas     | `edit 1,3,5 s/rejected` | Edited 3 companies (indices 1, 3, 5) - Status updated to rejected |
| **Range** | `edit START-END [fields]` | START ≤ END, inclusive | `edit 2-4 s/applied` | Edited 3 companies (indices 2, 3, 4) - Status updated to applied |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can combine both methods in one command! Use `edit 1,3,6-8,10 s/applied` to edit companies 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10 all at once.
</div>

**Clear any field:** Use empty value to clear
```
edit 3 t/           → All tags cleared
edit 3 r/           → Remark cleared  
edit 3 t/ r/        → Both tags and remark cleared
```

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Important - Field Replacement:**
All fields are **REPLACED**, not added to existing values:
- `edit 1 t/tech` → Removes all existing tags, sets only "tech"
- `edit 1 r/New remark` → Completely replaces existing remark
- `edit 1 t/` → Clears all tags
</div>

**Rules:**
- At least 1 field must be specified
- Indices must be positive integers within the current list size (e.g. if 5 companies shown, use indices 1-5 only)
- Duplicate indices are not allowed (e.g. `edit 1,1,2` or `edit 1,3,2-4` will throw an error)
- Space between indices are not allowed (e.g. `edit 3555`, not `edit 3 555`)
- Single editing: All fields allowed
- Batch editing: All fields allowed except Name (prevents creating duplicate company names)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
**:exclamation: Important - Index Reference:**<br>
Indices refer to the numbers shown in the **current displayed list**. After using `find` or `filter`, indices 1,2,3 refer to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd companies in the filtered results, not the original full list.
</div>

**Context Examples:**
- `list` → `edit 2` (edits 2nd company from full list)
- `find Goog` → `edit 1` (edits 1st company from search results)
- `filter applied` → `edit 1-3` (edits 1st company from filtered results)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use batch editing after applying: `edit 1-10 s/applied` updates all at once!
</div>

### Saving the data

Cerebro data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Cerebro data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, **Cerebro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.**
<br>Furthermore, certain edits can cause Cerebro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Upcoming Features
- Archiving & backing up data files
- Undo changes: Quickly revert mistaken edits or deletions
- Reminders: Stay on top of application deadlines

## FAQ

Common questions and troubleshooting for using Cerebro.

**Q: What happens if I add a company with the same name?**  
**A**: Company names must be unique (case-insensitive). Cerebro rejects duplicates and shows an error message.

**Q: How do I track multiple roles at the same company?**  
**A**: Use tags to differentiate positions (`add t/Google SWE` vs `add t/Google PM`) or/and add respective role details in remarks.

**Q: Can I undo a delete or clear operation?**
**A**: No, deletions are permanent and cannot be undone within the app. To recover deleted data:
1. Close Cerebro
2. Navigate to `[JAR location]/data/` folder
3. Replace `addressbook.json` with your backup file
4. Restart Cerebro

**Prevention tip:** Regularly backup your `addressbook.json` file before making major changes.

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**  
**A**: Install Cerebro on the new computer, then overwrite the empty data file with your existing `[JAR location]/data/addressbook.json`.

**Q: Can I edit the JSON file directly?**  
**A**: Yes, advanced users can edit `addressbook.json` directly. **Always backup first** - invalid format will cause Cerebro to discard all data.

**Q: How do I regenerate the dummy data?**  
**A**: Delete the `/data` folder, then run the app again. **Make sure to backup any important information first!**
