**Cerebro** is a desktop app for tracking a CS student’s **internship progress**. It’s designed to be **keyboard-driven** and fast for power users.

**Example usages:**
  - Track all internship applications in one place (company, role, status, calendar, notes).
  - Plan and prioritise upcoming deadlines by sorting/filtering entries.
  - Review progress over time for reflections or career-advising meetings.
  - Update and search quickly using keyboard-friendly commands.

The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Cerebro_) used for **managing internship progress**.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
  * It comes with a reasonable level of **user** and **developer** documentation.
* It is named `Cerebro` the way it was built in COM2 Cerebra garage like how Steve Jobs creates apple in a garage
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Cerebro Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f08a-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
